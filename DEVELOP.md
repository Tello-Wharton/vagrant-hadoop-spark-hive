Tips for those that want to make changes
========================================

# Versions

File [scripts/common.sh](scripts/common.sh) can be edited if you want to
change the version of a particular system.

Be wary that you might also need to change the hadoop version described
by the symbolic link in the function installSpark (in File [scripts/setup-spark.sh](scripts/setup-spark.sh))
